## What is CineCraft AI?

**CineCraft AI** is an AI-powered automation tool for the **Blockbuster Studio (BBS)** mod in Minecraft. It turns natural language descriptions into epic machinimas by automatically generating scenes, actors, cameras, and timing commands.

Designed for creators who want to make animations like [ZMDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HllSAOQ03EY), it handles the tedious technical work so you can focus on the story.
